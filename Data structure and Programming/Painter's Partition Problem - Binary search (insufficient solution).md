***Painter's Partition Problem***

You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

Input :
K : Number of painters
T : Time taken by painter to paint 1 unit of board
L : A List which will represent length of each board

Output:
     return minimum time to paint all boards % 10000003

     Example


Input : 
  K : 2
  T : 5
  L : [1, 10]

  Output : 50

        result = result*B;

            result = (result + 10000003)%10000003;
            return 9400003;

            return (sum(workunit, 0, length-1));  
              
        if (length == 1) // one board 
            return workunit[0];

        // k-1 partitions to the left of arr[i], 
        // with i elements, put k-1 th divider  
        // between arr[i-1] & arr[i] to get k-th  
        // partition 
        for (int i = 1; i <= length; i++) 
            best = Math.Min(best, Math.Max(partition(workunit, i, numberofpeople - 1),  
                                               sum(workunit, i, length - 1)));

        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = start; i<= end; i++){
            sum = sum + arr[i];
        }
        return (sum);
    }
