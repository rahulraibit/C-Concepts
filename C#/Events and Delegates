Events are a special kind of multicast delegate that can only be invoked from within the class or struct where they are declared (the publisher class). 
If other classes or structs subscribe to the event, their event handler methods will be called when the publisher class raises the event

Example:

public class SampleEventArgs
{
    public SampleEventArgs(string s) { Text = s; }
    public String Text { get; } // readonly
}

public class Publisher
{
    // Declare the delegate (if using non-generic pattern).
    public delegate void SampleEventHandler(object sender, SampleEventArgs e);

    // Declare the event.
    public event SampleEventHandler SampleEvent;

    // Wrap the event in a protected virtual method
    // to enable derived classes to raise the event.
    protected virtual void RaiseSampleEvent()
    {
        // Raise the event by using the () operator.
        if (SampleEvent != null)
            SampleEvent(this, new SampleEventArgs("Hello"));
    }
}

    //Class that subscribes to an event
    class Subscriber
    {
        private string id;
        public Subscriber(string ID, Publisher pub)
        {
            id = ID;
            // Subscribe to the event using C# 2.0 syntax
            pub.RaiseSampleEvent += HandleCustomEvent;
        }

        // Define what actions to take when the event is raised.
        void HandleCustomEvent(object sender, SampleEventArgs e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(id + " received this message: {0}", e.Message);
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Publisher pub = new Publisher();
            Subscriber sub1 = new Subscriber("sub1", pub);
            Subscriber sub2 = new Subscriber("sub2", pub);

            // Call the method that raises the event.
            pub.DoSomething();

            // Keep the console window open
            Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to close this window.");
            Console.ReadLine();

        }
    }

Events enable a class or object to notify other classes or objects when something of interest occurs. 
The class that sends (or raises) the event is called the publisher and the classes that receive (or handle) the event are called subscribers.

Events have the following properties:

1. The publisher determines when an event is raised; the subscribers determine what action is taken in response to the event.

2. An event can have multiple subscribers. A subscriber can handle multiple events from multiple publishers.

3. Events that have no subscribers are never raised.

4. Events are typically used to signal user actions such as button clicks or menu selections in graphical user interfaces.

5. When an event has multiple subscribers, the event handlers are invoked synchronously when an event is raised. To invoke events asynchronously, see Calling Synchronous Methods Asynchronously.

6. In the .NET Framework class library, events are based on the EventHandler delegate and the EventArgs base class.
